This project explores voter demographics through the lenses of age, income, and race, and how political parties within states, especially swing states, change over time. The interactive deep-dives into these two topics pushes the user to consider past social or economic phenomenons that have played into political decisions of which demographics decided to take the time to vote, and ultimately encourage them to vote for the 2020 election.

## Project Goals

We began this project with the goal of highlighting insights from previous elections to potentially show patterns between the population demographic and the results for a specific presidential election year. This project dives deeply into two parts of election data provided on the census website. By looking into the demographics through different lenses of age, income, and race, the user is displayed a set of visualizations that help read into which group of people were more proactive in voting than others. The second section shows a set of data that highlights the respective results of each state for each year while highlighting state-level specificity for the top 5 swing states. From an individual perspective, this visualization can explore the concept of where my vote stands amongst the greater population. In the context of a user feeling a certain way with the previous presidential elections, they are able to see who was considered “majority” in the voting population and how that had affected the results of that year. This probes the stakeholders to consider past social or economic phenomenons that have played into political decisions of which demographics decided to take the time to vote and encourage them to vote for the 2020 election.

## Design

It was important to emphasize to the user how voter demographic changes over time, and also connect that to changes in America’s dominant political parties over time. It made sense to accomplish this with a slider that allows the user to toggle between different years, and that would control the years for both the voter demographics and political parties sections at the same time. Because of the importance of this interaction, we decided to put it in the sidebar so the user always has access to it, and saves the hassle of constantly scrolling up and down on the app to change the year. 
One big shift in our design process was actually splitting up our project into two main sections. We originally planned to focus solely on the breakdown of political parties across states, and categorize voter relationships between left-leaning, swing, and right-leaning states. However, we found that the census data didn’t provide voter demographic data for individual states (except for 2010). Without this data, we realized there was no clear way to have political party data interact with voter data, and decided to split our interaction into two clear sections. In the long run, this decision paid off, because it pushes the user to consider two different, essential aspects of elections, and hopefully allow them to draw their own connections between the two through app interaction.
We noticed that we were naturally prone to creating a simple bar chart because most of the data points we had were either nominal or quantitative. For us to find a visualization that best portrayed the insights of our data, we had to frequently go back to our design process to talk about the different visualizations and which of them could be the most suitable for the type of information being conveyed.

## Development

The work was split very evenly between us. We had four zoom calls over the course of this project, where we discussed and laid out our app design, and split up who was responsible for making which visualizations. Our design meetings probably added up to a total of around 4 hours. As for using altair, streamlit, and duckdb to implement our planned visualizations, it was definitely a learning curve for both of us. This is our first data science class, and we both had never worked with databases, altair, or streamlit before. We spent hours struggling with virtual environment and data processing issues, and just learning and getting our first charts to work in general. After getting through those initial hurdles, it was mostly smooth sailing from there. The aspects that took the most time was data processing to ensure that the format we gave the altair chart functions was correct. We also spent a good amount of time thinking through our app design. Between the two of us, we probably put in a total of 40 hours into this project.
